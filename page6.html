</p><p>and at the same location as the biennial reorganization of the State Committee of the Arizona Democratic Party.
</p><p>All caucus members in good standing shall be eligible electors. Officers must receive an affirmative selection of a&nbsp;</p><p>majority of eligible votes cast; if no candidates receive such a majority, the person receiving the lowest number of
</p><p>votes in the current ballot is eliminated and a run-off is held. The procedure is repeated until a candidate receives
</p><p>a proper majority.
</p><p>B. Terms of office. The term of office for all officers shall be two years. Terms begin immediately upon

</p><p>another person takes the office as a result of election at biennial reorganization meeting; or the officer becomes a
</p><p>paid staff member of the Arizona Democratic Party or any of the County Democratic Parties.
</p><p>C. Any officer may be removed from office upon a two-thirds vote of the members in good standing.
</p><p>D. Vacancies may be temporarily filled by the chairperson. A special election must be held at the next regular

</p><p>Caucus.

</p><p>be reinstated after re-registration.
</p><p>Section 3. Membership in good standing. Membership in good standing is conferred by in-person attendance at

</p><p>Section 1. Regular meetings. General meetings of the membership of the Caucus will be held, without further or
</p><p>special notice, at the place and usually immediately before the regular meetings of the State Committee of the
</p><p>Arizona Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 2. Special meetings. Special meetings of the membership of the Caucus shall be held as called by the
</p><p>Steering Committee on such notice as is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Notice for special

</p><p>Section 2. Preference for consensus. The Caucus will prefer consensus ahead of majority rule. Members are
</p><p>encouraged to consider how best to act within the caucus to build consensus instead of contention, both in
</p><p>meetings of the Caucus and in communication between meetings.
</p><p>Section 3. Participation. All meetings, discussions, debates, and dialogues of the Caucus shall be as open as is
</p><p>reasonably possible and shall include the widest possible participation of the membership. Preference shall be
</p><p>placed upon the full participation of the whole membership. Breaches of the decorum of the Caucus shall require
</p><p>limitation on the participation of those participating in such a breach, e.g. argumentum ad hominem; disrespectful,
</p><p>hateful, or belligerent speech; and, abuse of the time and manner of debate or discussion.
</p><p>Section 4. ADP Bylaws. The current bylaws of the Arizona Democratic Party shall supersede these bylaws if they
</p><p>are found to be in conflict.
</p><p><br></p><p>ARTICLE 6. ACTING AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CAUCUS
</p><p>Section 1. Actions on behalf of the Caucus. Only the general membership voting at its meetings or the Steering
</p><p>Committee between general meetings shall be able to speak, decide, or act on behalf of AZSC. Any actions taken
</p><p>by the Steering Committee between general meetings shall, upon reasonable notice given to the Steering
</p><p>Committee by anyone seeking such review, be subject to review and modification by the subsequent regular
</p><p>meeting.
</p><p><br></p><p>ARTICLE 8. Committees

</p><p>membership of the committee. This chairperson shall serve as an ex-officio member of the Steering Committee of
</p><p>the Caucus.
